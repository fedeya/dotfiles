# Fedeya Dotfiles

This is my personal dotfiles repository. It contains my configuration files for miscellaneous programs and tools.

## Installation

To install the dotfiles, is necessary to install `chezmoi` first. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsLS git.io/chezmoi)" -- init --apply fedeya
```

This will clone the repository and apply the configuration to your system.
